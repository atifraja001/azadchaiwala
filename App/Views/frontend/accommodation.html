                    99% of our students come from outside of Mirpur and thus we know accomodation 
                    is a major issue for our students. Subject to availability we have accomodation we can 
                    offer you on a first come, first basis. This needs to be booked as soon as your seat 
                    for a course is confirmed. 
                </p>
                <p class="accommodation-paragraph">
                    Rooms are offered on a shared basis, monthly rent is 6,000 per person per month for month long courses. 2 weeks courses are charged at 3500 per person. We DO NOT OFFER FOOD.
                </p>
                <p class="accommodation-paragraph">
                    If our accomodation is not to your liking, we would be more than happy to find you alternative local accomodation with hostels or 3/4/5 star hotels. For this you can call us or write to us.
